This is the bug report template, use it only to submit bugs. If this is a feature suggestion, go back and use the "enhancement" template.

**The title of this submission must be a brief description of the bug to make it easier to find.***

Please use the formatting and provide the requested information (if we ask for versions, do not just say latest). If you do not, your issue will simply be ignored and closed. You may be asked by a dev to provide additional information. If you do not provide additional information within a reasonable window of time, your issue will also be closed. 
(Must state if using a release, alpha, or beta in the pack version section. Version numbers are handled separately between these!).

Before submitting an issue, make sure to search through existing bug reports to ensure you do not make a duplicate report, as this will simply slow down development!
