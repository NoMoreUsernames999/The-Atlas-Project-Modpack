This is the suggestion template. It is for suggesting features or gameplay changes, not mods. If you want to suggest a mod, do so through the Discord because it will likely not be accepted save for rare circumstances, and we don't need the issue tracker cluttered. 

===================================
The title of this issue should be a brief description of your suggestion to make it easier to find, with the beginning being the name of a suggestion category inside brackets "[]". See below for the categories. Please assign your submission to a project in the menu bar to the right (Not required, but saves me time). Click on projects, repository, and then on "bug tracking" if this is a bug report, or "project organization" if this is a suggestion. This helps us organize them.
===================================

Please provide the requested information. If you do not, your issue will simply be ignored and closed. You may be asked by a dev to provide additional information. If you do not provide additional information within a reasonable window of time, your issue will also be closed. 

Make sure to look at existing suggestions using the search feature so that you don't make duplicate suggestions. 

The different suggestion categories are: 
- Game mechanic: Related to general game mechanics.
- Recipe: Anything related to any kind of crafting or processing recipe.
- Mob: Anything related to mob spawning (minus the invasion feature), mob stats, or mob-planet distribution. 
- Worldgen: Anything related to general world generation.
- Planet: Anything related to planet design or features, as well as suggesting new planets (we rarely accept new planets unless it is relevant to progression and a unique enough design to warrant adding yet another dimension).
- Other: Anything that doesn't fit the above categories.
